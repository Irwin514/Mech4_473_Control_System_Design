# Mech4_473_Control_System_Design
Analog and digital controller designs. Analog controllers: lead/lag compensators, pole placement, model matching, two-parameter configuration, plant input/output feedback configuration. Digital controllers: difference equations, Z-transform, stability in the Z-domain, digital implementation of analog controllers, equivalent digital plant method, alias signals, selection of sampling time. Introduction to analog/digital state-space: controllability, observability, state feedback, state estimator. PI and PID controllers. Simulink assignments and project. Hardware laboratory project: analog and digital controller design for motor with inertial plus generator load
